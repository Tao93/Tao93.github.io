    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows HTTP is in plaintext and unsecure, and HTTPS is more secure. Just as the lock icon in Chrome address bar shows:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/30/1585623855.png" alt=""></p><p>But why is that? Just because of encryption? The reality could be more complicated, yet more interesting. Let’s go!</p><h3 id="What-is-secure-communication"><a href="#What-is-secure-communication" class="headerlink" title="What is secure communication"></a>What is secure communication</h3><p>First, we should abstractly specify what is secure communication (typically remote communication). Assume <strong>Alice (A)</strong> and <strong>Bob (B)</strong> are two characters to communicate remotely, and the meanful contents they send or receive are called <strong>messages</strong>.</p><p>There are 3 essential conditions of secure communication</p><h4 id="Confidentiality"><a href="#Confidentiality" class="headerlink" title="Confidentiality"></a>Confidentiality</h4><p>Only the A and B should be able to understand the contents of the transmitted message. Absolutely encryption and decryption are necessary.</p><h4 id="Message-integrity"><a href="#Message-integrity" class="headerlink" title="Message integrity"></a>Message integrity</h4><p>Ensure that the messages are not altered, either maliciously or by accident. Digest algorithms (explained laterly) is necessary for integrity.</p><h4 id="End-point-authentication"><a href="#End-point-authentication" class="headerlink" title="End-point authentication"></a>End-point authentication</h4><p>A and B should be able to confirm the identity of the other one, i.e. confirm that the other one is indeed who or what they claim to be.</p><h3 id="Why-need-secure-communication"><a href="#Why-need-secure-communication" class="headerlink" title="Why need secure communication"></a>Why need secure communication</h3><p>The Internet is built with numerous routers, switchers, hosts and other devices. Data sent from our PCs or phones would go through so many transit devices, but the hardwares of the Internet doesn’t provide secure communication. Some security protocols in network layer or below layers are also unreliable since they’re implemented in routers or switchers.</p><h3 id="Encryption"><a href="#Encryption" class="headerlink" title="Encryption"></a>Encryption</h3><p>Roughly divided, there’re two kinds of Encryption: Symmetric and Asymmetric.</p><h4 id="Symmetric-Encryption"><a href="#Symmetric-Encryption" class="headerlink" title="Symmetric Encryption"></a>Symmetric Encryption</h4><p>With long history, widely used in wars befoer modern era for thousands yesrs to pass confidential information. </p><p>Symmectric Encryption is symmectric because A and B use same secret key to encrypt and decrypt the messages:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/30/1585625689.png" alt=""></p><p>The biggest inconvenience of symmetric is that A must be handed over the secret key to B before any communication, and this is hard for remote communication. In wars, we often see codebooks must be carried to frontlines safely.</p><p>Common symmetric encryption algorithms are AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard) etc.</p><h4 id="Asymmetric-Encryption"><a href="#Asymmetric-Encryption" class="headerlink" title="Asymmetric Encryption"></a>Asymmetric Encryption</h4><p>In Asymmetric Encryption, Keys are have two kinds: public keys and private keys. A has his public key and private key, so does B. Hence there’re 4 different keys, and the private keys must be only accessible to the owners.</p><p>Asymmetric Encryption are also called public-key encryption.</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/31/1585627448.png" alt=""></p><p>The most famous asymmetric encryptions are the RSA algorithm and Elliptic curve algorithm. Asymmetric Encryption fulfill the following conditions:</p><ol><li>both public key and private key could be used to encrypt or decrypt;</li><li>for a pair of keys, the public key can decrypt anything encrypted with the private key, vice versa;</li><li>it’s very hard to calculate the private key with given public key.</li></ol><p>The concrete steps of the RSA algorithm:</p><ol><li>Choose 2 large primes <script type="math/tex">p</script> and <script type="math/tex">q</script>; the larger the values, the difficult to calculate private key from public key, but also the slower to encrypt and decrypt.</li><li>Compute <script type="math/tex">n = pq</script> and <script type="math/tex">z = (p – 1)(q – 1)</script>.</li><li>Choose a number <script type="math/tex">e</script>, less than <script type="math/tex">n</script>, that has no common factors with <script type="math/tex">z</script>.</li><li>Find a number <script type="math/tex">d</script>, such that <script type="math/tex">(ed – 1 \mod z) = 0</script>.</li><li>Public key is the pair of numbers <script type="math/tex">(n, e)</script>, private key is <script type="math/tex">(n, d)</script></li><li>For any integer <script type="math/tex">m<n</script>, calculate <script type="math/tex">(m^{e} \mod n)</script> to encrypt or decrypt it with public key, similar for private key.</li></ol><p>With given <script type="math/tex">n</script>, calculate the large primes <script type="math/tex">p</script> and <script type="math/tex">q</script> is hard, that’s why RSA is safe.</p><p>The following facts ensures the 2rd conditions that RSA fulfills:</p><ol><li><script type="math/tex">(a + b) \mod n = [(a \mod n) + (b \mod n)] \mod n</script>.</li><li>if <script type="math/tex">p</script> and <script type="math/tex">q</script> are primes, <script type="math/tex">n = pq</script>, and <script type="math/tex">z = (p – 1)(q – 1)</script>, then <script type="math/tex">x^y \mod n</script> is the same as <script type="math/tex">x^{y \mod z} \mod n</script>.</li></ol><p>With 1st of the above facts, there is <script type="math/tex">[(a \mod n)^d \mod n] = [a^d \mod n]</script>, then there is:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">(m^e \mod n)^d \mod n = m^{ed} \mod n = m^{ed \mod z} \mod n = m \mod n = m</script><p>With asymmetric encryption, A and B publically publish their public keys. A could encrypt messages by using B’s public key before send them to B. After receive A’s encrypted message, B could decrypt the encrypted messages to get the original contents:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/31/1585628013.png" alt=""></p><p>Except A and B, no one could decrypt the encrypted messages as long as their private keys are safe. Seems perfect! However, there’re man in the middle attacks!</p><p>Imagine a hacker called Eve controlled a router between A and B, and is able to see all data passed between A and B. Then when A and B exchange their public keys, Eve could manipulate the router to replace A and B’s public keys with Eve’s public key, thus A and B would encrypt messages with Eve’s public key, and all encrypted messages are decryptable to Eve. Yet A and B might be unware of this:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/31/1585630134.png" alt=""></p><p>Aparently, the critical point to avoid the MITM (man in the middle) attack is making sure the public key exchange cound’t be tampered. In real world, certificates and certificate authority (CA) are invented to solve this.</p><h4 id="Pros-and-cons-of-Asymmetric-and-Symmetric"><a href="#Pros-and-cons-of-Asymmetric-and-Symmetric" class="headerlink" title="Pros and cons of Asymmetric and Symmetric"></a>Pros and cons of Asymmetric and Symmetric</h4><p><strong>Symmetric</strong>: simple and fast, but need to make sure the same key is only accessible to A and B.</p><p><strong>Asymmetric</strong>: complex and slow, only needs the public key exchange.</p><p>In real Internet, they’re working together in HTTPS.</p><p>Besides, digital signature was based on asymmetric encryption.</p><h4 id="Digest"><a href="#Digest" class="headerlink" title="Digest"></a>Digest</h4><p>Digest algorithms are also called hash functions. A digest algorithm maps input of any length to an output with fixed length. </p><p>A good digest algorithm fulfills that, for any input <script type="math/tex">x</script>, it’s hard to find another input <script type="math/tex">y</script> such that digest of <script type="math/tex">y</script> is same as <script type="math/tex">x</script>.</p><p>Common digest algorithms are MD5 and SHA:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/31/1585680049.png" alt=""></p><p>Digest is also used to verify the integrity of large file you downloaded form Internet.</p><h4 id="Digital-signature"><a href="#Digital-signature" class="headerlink" title="Digital signature"></a>Digital signature</h4><p>A real world signature, to some extent, can prove that someone certified a document. This requires that no one can imitate handwriting of others.</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/31/1585680509.png" alt=""></p><p>Digital signature is based on asymmetric encryption. Assume you keep your private key safe (only accessible to yourself). For any message, you calculate its digest and encrypted the digest with your private key, then the message and the encrypted digest form a digital signature by you:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/31/1585680879.png" alt=""></p><p>Anyone holds your real public key can verify the digital signature, and no one can forge your signature.</p><h4 id="Certificate-and-certificate-chain"><a href="#Certificate-and-certificate-chain" class="headerlink" title="Certificate and certificate chain"></a>Certificate and certificate chain</h4><p>You definitely want everyone who holds your public key is really your public key. To achieve this, we need certificate.</p><p>Let’s look at the real world network communication. There are numerous servers, yet there are more clients like our PCs and phones. Certificates would help us (clients) to get the real public keys of servers, and confirm the identify of a server.</p><p>Certificates are public, encoded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X.509</a> format, and contain (but not only) the following information:</p><ol><li>basic info of the certificate owner, i.e. the server.</li><li>public key of the server.</li><li>basic info and signature of the issuer of the certificate.</li></ol><p>An example of certificate owned by wikipedia:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/31/1585682422.png" alt=""></p><p>In the world, there are some entities called certificate authorities (CAs), and some of them are called root CAs. The certificates owned by root CAs are called root certificates.</p><p>A certificate is called self-signed if the issuer is the owner itself. Actually root certificates are self-signed.</p><p>Root certificates are powerful because many of them are embedded in our client devices when they were made in factory (we can also install certificates to our devices, i.e. trust the installed certificates). Thus when a client communicates with a root CA, the client can confirm identity of the server by requesting digital signature of random message from the server.</p><p>Common root CAs are: Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign and DigiCert etc.</p><p>But how about ordinary servers? How to identify them? Certificate chains would help us.</p><p>In a certificate chain with 3 certificates:</p><ol><li>the 1st certificate is a root certificate, owned and issued by a root CA; </li><li>the 2nd is called intermediate certificate, owned by a CA and issued by the root CA;</li><li>the 3rd certificate (end entity certificate) is owned by a ordinary server and issued by the intermediate CA.</li></ol><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/31/1585692503.png" alt=""></p><p>If the root certificate is trusted by client, then the client can verify the signature in intermediate certificate, and confirm whether the intermediate certificate is really issued by the root CA. If so, then the public key (of intermediate CA) in intermediate certificate would be able to verify the 3rd certificate. Overall, the client is able to verify the whole certificate chain.</p><p>But verifying the certificate chain is not enough. Furthuremore, the client could request a signature of random message from the ordinary server, and verify the signature with public key from the end entity certificate, thus finally confirm identity of the oridinary server.</p><h4 id="Rough-steps-to-establish-secure-communication"><a href="#Rough-steps-to-establish-secure-communication" class="headerlink" title="Rough steps to establish secure communication"></a>Rough steps to establish secure communication</h4><p>The following is the rough steps to establish secure communication. They don’t reflect the real things in HTTPS, but provide the abstract skeleton.</p><ol><li>Server send certificate chain.</li><li>Client verify the certificate chain with its lcoally trusted certificates, then send random message to server.</li><li>Server sign the message, and send signature back to client.</li><li>Client verify the signature, then send some params from which both side could generate symmtric encryption key, of course the params are encrypted with Server’s public key.</li><li>Both sides generate symmtric key, with which then they could communicate securely and quickly.</li><li>Usually, the client has to provide credentials (encrypted with symmtric key) for authentication.</li></ol><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/31/1585693925.png" alt=""></p><h4 id="Certificate-pinning"><a href="#Certificate-pinning" class="headerlink" title="Certificate pinning"></a>Certificate pinning</h4><p>Only trust a specific certificate, or certificates issued by owner of that specific certificate.</p><p>Our Android app accept certificates as asset resources to enable certificate pinning. Concretely, we have a customized <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/X509TrustManager.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X509TrustManager</a>. The customized X509TrustManager read certificates from asset resources, override the <code>checkServerTrusted</code> method to achieve the goal, and would be set into <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/SSLSocketFactory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSLSocketFactory</a>.</p><p>For security, we should only add end entity certificate to the asset resources, or other certificates issued by intermediate CAs would be trusted by our App.</p><h4 id="ECDH-Elliptic-curve-Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange-algorithm"><a href="#ECDH-Elliptic-curve-Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange-algorithm" class="headerlink" title="ECDH (Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman) Key Exchange algorithm"></a>ECDH (Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman) Key Exchange algorithm</h4><p>There are 2 kinds of key exchange algorithms: RSA based and Diffie-Hellman algorithm. </p><p>RSA based Key exchange algorithm is simpler, in which the client would generate the symmtric key by itsefl, then encrypt it with server’s public key and send it to server. </p><p>While the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is more complex. The following is a vivid demonstration of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/31/1585701668.png" alt=""></p><p>In above diagram: </p><ol><li>secret colors are private keys;</li><li>secret colors + common paint = public keys (it’s hard to get secret colors from common paint and public keys)</li><li>A’s public key + B’s secret color = A’s secret color + B’s public key, and that’s the symmetric key.</li></ol><p>Therefore, in Diffie-Hellman algorithm, A and B could calculate the symmetric key respectively. </p><p>Original Diffie-Hellman algorithm is based on exponential modular. Assume <script type="math/tex">p</script> is a prime and <script type="math/tex">k</script> is a primitive root modulo <script type="math/tex">p</script> and both of them are public. Private keys are random numbers <script type="math/tex">d_A</script> and <script type="math/tex">d_B</script>, public keys are <script type="math/tex">k^{d_A} \mod p</script> and <script type="math/tex">k^{d_B} \mod p</script>, and the secret key for symmectric encryption is <script type="math/tex">k^{d_A d_B} \mod p</script>.</p><p>The ECDH Key Exchange algorithm is enhanced by replacing exponential modular with elliptic curve group. </p><h4 id="The-real-TLS-handshake-in-HTTPS"><a href="#The-real-TLS-handshake-in-HTTPS" class="headerlink" title="The real TLS handshake in HTTPS"></a>The real TLS handshake in HTTPS</h4><p>HTTPS = HTTP + TLS (deprecated predecessor is SSL). </p><p>In most programming languages, socket acts as API between Transport layer and Application layer. With TLS, a new abstract sublayer is added:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/31/1585695667.png" alt=""></p><p>Although TLS is in the application layer, from the developer’s perspective it’s like a transport-layer protocol.</p><p>The following is an example of TLS handshake procedure. In the example the key exchange algorithm is not RSA, hence the following diagram and steps couldn’t exactly represents TLS handshake using RSA as key exchange algorithm.</p><p>Diagram of TLS handshake using ECDH key exchange algorithm:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/31/1585697894.png" alt=""></p><h5 id="1-Client-Hello"><a href="#1-Client-Hello" class="headerlink" title="1.

So this is a general example, how about when <script type="math/tex">m</script> is just <script type="math/tex">n</script>? What’s the <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script> is this group?</p><p>The <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script> is still the infinitely far point. Well, this seems strange becase the infinitely far point is not in the discrete elliptic curve.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoof%27s_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schoof’s algorithm</a> is an efficient algorithm to calculate the number of points.</p><p>Similar with previous continuous elliptic curve, we can perform scalar multipilication:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">dm = \sum_{i=1}^d m</script><p>where <script type="math/tex">d</script> is a positive integer and <script type="math/tex">m</script> is an element in the group. </p><p>For any <script type="math/tex">m</script> in such a group <script type="math/tex">G</script>, the smallest integer <script type="math/tex">d</script> such that <script type="math/tex">dm</script> equals <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script> is called the order of the subgroup which consists of <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script>, <script type="math/tex">m</script>, <script type="math/tex">2m</script>, <script type="math/tex">3m</script>, …, <script type="math/tex">(d-1)m</script>. The subgroup is cyclic. And the number of elements in a subgroup is called <strong>order</strong> of the subgroup.</p><p>Let’s say the order of the parent group is <script type="math/tex">D</script>. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_theorem_(group_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lagrange’s theorem</a>), the order of a subgroup is a diviser of <script type="math/tex">D</script>. </p><p>As an example, lets use the <script type="math/tex">y^2 \equiv x^3 - 7x + 10 \mod 19</script> and assum3 <script type="math/tex">m</script> is <script type="math/tex">(1, 2)</script>.

Show as below:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/29/1585522273.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>In above diagram, the order of the parent group is 24. The order of the subgroup is 8, which is a diviser of 24. Also for the point <script type="math/tex">(7, 0)</script>, its inverse point is itself (actually the slope value here is infinity).</p><p>Note that different subgroups might share points. For instance, in the above example any subgroup whose base point is <script type="math/tex">m</script> order is an even number <script type="math/tex">s</script>, then <script type="math/tex">\frac{s}{2}m</script> is the point <script type="math/tex">(7, 0)</script>.</p><p>Hence for any <script type="math/tex">m</script> in the parent group, we can check the divisers of <script type="math/tex">D</script> one by one to find out the order of subgroup based on <script type="math/tex">m</script>. </p><p>On the contrary, for any prime diviser <script type="math/tex">d</script> of <script type="math/tex">D</script>, any element point <script type="math/tex">m</script> such that <script type="math/tex">(D/d)m</script> not equal the <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script> is the base point to form a subgroup whose order is <script type="math/tex">d</script>.

The plus operation is similar to the operation we defined previously for elliptic curve over real numbers.</p><p>The identity element is same as before. The reverse pair of elements are symmectircal over the line <script type="math/tex">y = P/2</script>.</p><p>For any pointers <script type="math/tex">m</script> and <script type="math/tex">n</script> on the discrete curve and <script type="math/tex">x_m \ne x_n</script>, <script type="math/tex">m \oplus n</script> is the reverse proint of the 3rd intersection between the discrete curve points and the lines denoted by:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">ax + by + c\equiv 0 \mod P</script><p>when one of the lines cross <script type="math/tex">m</script> and <script type="math/tex">n</script>, and <script type="math/tex">a</script>, <script type="math/tex">c</script> and <script type="math/tex">c</script> are inetger constants.</p><p>The following is an example, where the discrete elliptic curve equation is <script type="math/tex">y^2 \equiv x^3 - 7x + 10 \mod 19</script>, and the lines equation is <script type="math/tex">y \equiv 2x \mod 19</script>:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/29/1585518712.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>In above diagram, <script type="math/tex">m</script> and <script type="math/tex">n</script> are <script type="math/tex">(1, 2)</script> and <script type="math/tex">(5, 10)</script> respectively, while <script type="math/tex">m \oplus n</script> is <script type="math/tex">(17, 4)</script>. So this is a general example, how about when <script type="math/tex">m</script> is just <script type="math/tex">n</script>? What’s the <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script> is this group?</p><p>The <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script> is still the infinitely far point. Well, this seems strange becase the infinitely far point is not in the discrete elliptic curve. And there has <script type="math/tex">m \oplus n = \circledcirc</script> when <script type="math/tex">x_m = x_n, y_m \ne y_n</script>.</p><p>When <script type="math/tex">m</script> is just <script type="math/tex">n</script>, we can also get the tangent line whose slope value is the derivative of the elliptic curve equation at the point <script type="math/tex">m</script>.</p><p>It could be proved with such a plus operation defined, a group is generated on the discrete elliptic curve over a finite field from prime <script type="math/tex">P</script>.</p><p>The number of points (including the <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script>) in such a group is called the <strong>order</strong> of the group. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoof%27s_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schoof’s algorithm</a> is an efficient algorithm to calculate the number of points.</p><p>Similar with previous continuous elliptic curve, we can perform scalar multipilication:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">dm = \sum_{i=1}^d m</script><p>where <script type="math/tex">d</script> is a positive integer and <script type="math/tex">m</script> is an element in the group. </p><p>For any <script type="math/tex">m</script> in such a group <script type="math/tex">G</script>, the smallest integer <script type="math/tex">d</script> such that <script type="math/tex">dm</script> equals <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script> is called the order of the subgroup which consists of <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script>, <script type="math/tex">m</script>, <script type="math/tex">2m</script>, <script type="math/tex">3m</script>, …, <script type="math/tex">(d-1)m</script>. The subgroup is cyclic. And the number of elements in a subgroup is called <strong>order</strong> of the subgroup.</p><p>Let’s say the order of the parent group is <script type="math/tex">D</script>. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_theorem_(group_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lagrange’s theorem</a>), the order of a subgroup is a diviser of <script type="math/tex">D</script>. </p><p>As an example, lets use the <script type="math/tex">y^2 \equiv x^3 - 7x + 10 \mod 19</script> and assum3 <script type="math/tex">m</script> is <script type="math/tex">(1, 2)</script>. It could be calculated that <script type="math/tex">m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 6m, 7m, 8m</script> are <script type="math/tex">(1, 2), (18, 15), (9, 12), (7, 0), (9, 7), (18, 4), (1, 17), \circledcirc</script>. Show as below:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2020/03/29/1585522273.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>In above diagram, the order of the parent group is 24. The order of the subgroup is 8, which is a diviser of 24. Also for the point <script type="math/tex">(7, 0)</script>, its inverse point is itself (actually the slope value here is infinity).</p><p>Note that different subgroups might share points. For instance, in the above example any subgroup whose base point is <script type="math/tex">m</script> order is an even number <script type="math/tex">s</script>, then <script type="math/tex">\frac{s}{2}m</script> is the point <script type="math/tex">(7, 0)</script>.</p><p>Hence for any <script type="math/tex">m</script> in the parent group, we can check the divisers of <script type="math/tex">D</script> one by one to find out the order of subgroup based on <script type="math/tex">m</script>. </p><p>On the contrary, for any prime diviser <script type="math/tex">d</script> of <script type="math/tex">D</script>, any element point <script type="math/tex">m</script> such that <script type="math/tex">(D/d)m</script> not equal the <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script> is the base point to form a subgroup whose order is <script type="math/tex">d</script>. (Hint: <script type="math/tex">Dm</script> is always the <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script>.)</p><p>Given <script type="math/tex">m</script> and <script type="math/tex">n</script> in such a group G, getting a <script type="math/tex">k</script> such that <script type="math/tex">km=n</script> is also very hard for some instances of discrete elliptic curve, just like the logrithm problem we mentioned previously.</p><h4 id="Elliptic-curve-cryptography-applications"><a href="#Elliptic-curve-cryptography-applications" class="headerlink" title="Elliptic curve cryptography applications"></a>Elliptic curve cryptography applications</h4><p>To leverage elliptic curve group over finite fileds on primes, there are some parameters called domain parameters to determine the concrete elliptic curve instances.</p><ol><li><script type="math/tex">a</script> and <script type="math/tex">b</script>, real numbers to determine the <script type="math/tex">y^2 = x^3 + ax + b</script> equation.</li><li><script type="math/tex">p</script>, a prime that determine the finite field of 0, 1, 2, 3, …, <script type="math/tex">p-1</script> .</li><li><script type="math/tex">G</script>, a base point in the discrete elliptic curve to form a cyclic subgroup of <script type="math/tex">G</script>, <script type="math/tex">2G</script>, <script type="math/tex">3G</script>, …, <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script>.</li><li><script type="math/tex">n</script>, which is order of the subgroup based on <script type="math/tex">G</script>, hence <script type="math/tex">nG</script> is the <script type="math/tex">\circledcirc</script>.</li><li><script type="math/tex">h</script>, called cofactor, which is result of <script type="math/tex">n</script> divides the order of the parent group.</li></ol><p>The above <script type="math/tex">(p, a, b, G, n, h)</script> consists the domain parameters that determine the concrete instances.

Alice and Bob have their private keys <script type="math/tex">d_A</script> and <script type="math/tex">d_B</script>. With the public domain parameters, they would compute <script type="math/tex">d_A G</script> and <script type="math/tex">d_B G</script> and exchange these two values (public keys). Finally, they would compute <script type="math/tex">d_A d_B G</script> and <script type="math/tex">d_B d_A G</script> respectively as the secret key for symmetric encryption. Of course <script type="math/tex">d_A d_B G = d_B d_A G</script>.</p><p>The EC Diffie-Hellman key exchange is based on that given the domain parameters, it’s hard to know <script type="math/tex">d_A d_B G</script> given <script type="math/tex">d_A G</script> and <script type="math/tex">d_B G</script>, and same for <script type="math/tex">d_A</script> and <script type="math/tex">d_B</script>.</p><p>While the original Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is based on exponential modular.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="前言"><a href="#前言" class="headerlink" title="前言"></a>前言</h3><p>提起 macOS，大家可能会想到精致、广告少、软硬搭配极佳、Unix 等等，这些也是 macOS 逐渐在软件开发者、设计师、文字工作者等群里中成为「标配」的原因。然而总结我这几年的使用经验，我认为有许多工具和方法，可以在默认的 macOS 基础上，更进一步提高我们的效率。本文基于 macOS 10.14.6，不比较 macOS 和其它系统孰优孰劣，而是针对「所有用户」和「程序员」两个群体分别分享一些我的经验，欢迎讨论和交流。另外，本文推荐的几乎都是免费或者开源的工具，嗯，我就是这么为大家的钱包着想（<del>我可不会说是因为我穷</del>）。</p><h3 id="对所有用户"><a href="#对所有用户" class="headerlink" title="对所有用户"></a>对所有用户</h3><h4 id="剪贴板管理"><a href="#剪贴板管理" class="headerlink" title="剪贴板管理"></a>剪贴板管理</h4><p>剪贴板管理工具帮我们维护文本和<strong>图片</strong>的复制历史，从而让我们能粘贴上上上上上上上上上上上上(<del>请不要说我凑字数</del>)…次复制的内容。显而易见这是对任何人都非常有用 enhancement，这也是为啥我把它放在第一个介绍。现在 <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alfred</a> 等工具已集成了剪贴板管理的功能，不过，本着开源优先(<del>免费</del>)的原则，我要推荐的是 GitHub 上的 <a href="https://github.com/Clipy/Clipy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clipy</a>，安装并稍微设置后，按下设定好的快捷键，就能出现下图的弹框：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/08/03/1564845517.png" alt=""></p><p>然后只需要按上下方向键选择，就可以粘贴上上上上…次复制过的内容了。不过需要强调的是，在 Clipy 的<a href="https://github.com/Clipy/Clipy/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">下载页面</a>，务必下载 1.15 版本，因为 1.2.0 和 1.2.1 都有一个 bug 使得它无法将复制的图片纳入管理。</p><h4 id="软件卸载"><a href="#软件卸载" class="headerlink" title="软件卸载"></a>软件卸载</h4><p>众所周知，macOS 上安装软件一般是将一个 XXX.app 拖到一个 Applications 目录中，也就是一个拷贝的动作，完成这个后，我们就可以通过 Spotlight 搜索或者在 Launchpad 点击图标来打开它。事实上，XXX.app 其实是一个目录，而不是一个后缀为 app 的文件，这可以通过在 XXX.app 上右键，然后点击<code>Show Package contents</code>，如图：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/08/03/1564845703.png" alt=""></p><p>XXX.app 目录包含一个软件运行起来所需的所有文件，但当我们打开一个新安装的软件，它往往会在一些别的地方 (不在 Applications 也不在 XXX.app 中) 生成一些配置文件。所以仅仅在 Applications 中删除 XXX.app 并不能移除生成的配置文件，从而如果哪天再次安装这个软件，老的配置依然会产生作用。若要彻底卸载软件，可以使用轻量级的 <a href="https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppCleaner</a>，它可以帮我们搜索出需卸载软件的本体和所有配置文件，然后我们选择删除哪些：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/08/03/1564846208.png" alt=""></p><h4 id="解压缩"><a href="#解压缩" class="headerlink" title="解压缩"></a>解压缩</h4><p>对于软件，其实我是能用系统自带的就用系统自带的，然而 macOS 上面的 <code>Archive Utility.app</code> 解压某些格式时会出错，也不能选择文本编码，所以就有必要使用第三方解压软件了，比如轻量的 <a href="https://theunarchiver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Unarchiver</a> 了。</p><h4 id="文本编辑器"><a href="#文本编辑器" class="headerlink" title="文本编辑器"></a>文本编辑器</h4><p>同样的，macOS 的 <code>TextEdit.app</code> 也是不堪重任，就好比是 Windows 上的记事本一样。如果你也不知道自己该用什么文本编辑器，那 <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sublime Text</a> 是个很不错的选择。轻量、功能强大、定制行强、支持各种花式的插件，这就是 Sublime Text。我最喜欢它的一个功能是，在它的一个 tab 中写点东西，不用保存为文件就可以退出软件甚至关机，等下次打开它，一切内容都恢复了，这特别适合用来记点东西。</p><h4 id="窗口管理"><a href="#窗口管理" class="headerlink" title="窗口管理"></a>窗口管理</h4><p>窗口管理也就是把窗口放大缩写和挪动的操作。macOS 默认的窗口操作被一些人认为不如 Windows 好用，其实我认为稍微设置一下，就能让这些人的🤐啦。首先，macOS 其实不需要我们经常回到桌面，这有别于 Windows 的经常回到桌面点击图标启动软件。macOS 中，当需要切换到别的软件时，不应该用最小化 (快捷键 Cmd+M) 的操作，因为永远不知道最小化后露出来的是哪一个软件，所以应该直接点击或 Cmd+Tab 前往想要去的软件，除非你的某个软件真的有见不得人的东西，别人来到你电脑前时你可以疾速地按下 Cmd+M 组合键。更别提最小化后，键盘操作将不能把该窗口拉回来，而只能靠点 击 (鼠标或触摸板)，而通常键盘操作更快速。</p><p>扯远了，回到窗口管理，如果愿意付费，可以选用 <a href="https://manytricks.com/moom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moom</a> 或 <a href="https://www.folivora.ai/bettersnaptool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BetterSnapTool</a> 两款付费软件，当然他们都可免费试用。它们提供足够的功能让我们花式管理窗口，快捷键也好，触发角也罢。如果你不想大动干戈，其实我们最需要的只有两个操作：窗口最大化(不是开启全屏视图)和窗口大小回退。前者让我们将当前软件填满屏幕，从而聚精会神工作(<del>摸鱼</del>)；后者意思是让窗口从最大化变回本来的大小。这两个操作一般可以通过 macOS 自带的 Zoom 操作，也就是 menu bar 中 Window 菜单下的 Zoom。这个 Zoom 默认没有快捷键，不过我们可以在系统中设置：<code>System Preferences.app</code> &gt; <code>Keyboard</code> &gt; <code>Shortcuts</code> &gt; <code>App Shortcuts</code>，然后点<code>+</code>按钮并如下添加：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/08/04/1564848618.png" alt=""></p><p>此后按上面设置的快捷键，就能最大窗口化和回退窗口了。</p><h4 id="快捷键"><a href="#快捷键" class="headerlink" title="快捷键"></a>快捷键</h4><p>快捷键的世界纷繁复杂，有时候甚至不小心触发了个什么快捷键却不知情，然后一脸😳。言归正传，适用最广，使用频率最高的少数基本快捷键才是最值得提的：</p><div class="table-container"><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">快捷键</th><th style="text-align:center">作用</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">Cmd + N</td><td style="text-align:center">一般是新建窗口</td><td></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Cmd + T</td><td style="text-align:center">一般是新建 Tab 标签页</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Cmd + ` (ESC 下方按键)</td><td style="text-align:center">在当前软件的不同窗口间切换</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Cmd + Shift + [</td><td style="text-align:center">当前窗口向左侧 Tab 切换</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Cmd + Shift + ]</td><td style="text-align:center">当前窗口向右侧 Tab 切换</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Cmd + W</td><td style="text-align:center">关闭当前 Tab 或当前窗口</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Cmd + Q</td><td style="text-align:center">彻底退出软件</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Ctrl + Cmd + Space</td><td style="text-align:center">卖萌时可用，试试你就知道了</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Option + Cmd + C</td><td style="text-align:center">复制文件或目录的路径</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Cmd + L</td><td style="text-align:center">Safari 与 Chrome 中 focus 地址栏</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Option + Cmd + Delete</td><td style="text-align:center">永久删除目录或文件</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">F11</td><td style="text-align:center">扒开所有窗口看下桌面</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Cmd + ,</td><td style="text-align:center">进偏好设置，对几乎所有软件有效</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>macOS 有 Mission Control 和 App Exposé 两个功能，分别有默认的快捷键 Cmd + ↑ 和 Cmd + ↓，前者显示所有窗口，后者显示当前软件的所有窗口。当然，它们还可以在触摸板设置中通过设置手势来触发。</p><p>Windows 中出现一个弹框时，我们可以按 Tab 键来切换 focus 到不同按钮上，然后按 Enter 或空格来代替点击按钮。macOS 其实也可以，但默认未开启，开启方法是：<code>System Preferences.app</code> &gt; <code>Keyboard</code> &gt; <code>Shortcuts</code>，然后 <code>Full Keyboard Access</code> 选中 <code>All controls</code> 即可。</p><p>在一些大键盘上，右侧会有很多没有存在感的按键，比如 Home 和 End。其实它们的作用之一是将光标移动到行首/行末，所以它们搭配上 Shift 按键，就可以快速选中当前光标至行首/行末的文本，即快捷键 Home/End + Shift。而要选中整行，也可先 Home 然后 End + Shift 即可。macOS 中，Home 和 End 可分别由 Cmd + ← 和 Cmd + → 实现，如此一来，按下 Cmd 和 Shift 再按左右方向键即可。</p><p>有时候我们想强退一些无响应的软件，可以按 Option + Cmd + ESC 然后在窗口中强退某个软件。如果你不记得这个快捷键，通常在 Dock 中右键图标也会有强退的选项。提到 ESC，顺便说一下，绝大部分各式各样的小弹框，都可以通过按 ESC 来把弹框关闭掉。</p><h4 id="光标要快"><a href="#光标要快" class="headerlink" title="光标要快"></a>光标要快</h4><p>如果你认为我说的是光标随鼠标或手指在触摸板上移动速度的快慢，那你就错啦！虽然我的确建议前面说的这个快慢可以…搞快点（毕竟这样可以减少有时候在触摸板上手指滑动一次还没到目的地，需要抬起手指接力继续滑动)，可我更想说的是<strong>长按</strong>键盘的左右方向键时，光标在字符之间移动的速度。首次使用 Mac 时，我就发现这个移动速度太慢，令人抓狂！幸而不就我就得知在 <code>System Preferences.app</code> &gt; <code>Keyboard</code> 中把 <code>Key Repeat</code> 和 <code>Delay Until Repeat</code> 都设置到最右侧，就能长按左右方向键时，光标比较快地移动了。</p><p>什么？你还要更快？嗯，办法也是有的，按住 Option 的同时，长按或连击左右方向键，光标将以英文 word 为单位移动，所以移动速度会更快。</p><h4 id="默认打开方式"><a href="#默认打开方式" class="headerlink" title="默认打开方式"></a>默认打开方式</h4><p>说到这个就想起 Xcode，但凡和代码有点关系的文件，macOS 都会默认让 Xcode 打开。发生这种情况时，我都是疾速地 Cmd+Q 退出 Xcode 然后在 Finder 中右键刚刚打开的文件，此时<strong>按住 Option</strong> 并在 <code>Always Open With</code> 菜单中选择我想要的软件，比如 <code>Sublime Text</code>，到这，Xcode 再也无法染指这个文件格式了 😏。</p><h4 id="简单管理启动项"><a href="#简单管理启动项" class="headerlink" title="简单管理启动项"></a>简单管理启动项</h4><p>Windows 中我们往往用各种电脑管家来限制某些软件开机自启的流氓行为，macOS 中这样的流氓少很多，但当真的有了的时候，或者我们偏要把某些软件设置自启 (比如我会把邮件客户端设置开机自启，这样电脑重启后，我不会忘记打开它而错过邮件通知，<del>嗯，我就是热爱工作</del>)。操作很简单，<code>System Preferences.app</code> &gt; <code>Users &amp; Groups</code> &gt; <code>Login Items</code>，然后不想要的 login item 删掉，想增加的加上，OK。推荐把每天都用的工具软件加上去，比如前面说的 Clipy。</p><h4 id="截屏与录屏"><a href="#截屏与录屏" class="headerlink" title="截屏与录屏"></a>截屏与录屏</h4><p>macOS 系统自带的截屏功能，在 <code>System Preferences.app</code> &gt; <code>Keyboard</code> &gt; <code>Shortcuts</code> &gt; <code>Screenshots</code> 中可一览无遗，如下图所示：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/08/04/1564911138.png" alt=""></p><p>有截取全屏和截取选中区域并放到剪贴板；也有截取全屏和截取选中区域并<strong>作为文件保存</strong>到桌面，并且这种方式下，截图刚完成时桌面右下角会和 iOS 一样短时间内显示一个缩略图，点击它的话可以编辑刚刚的截图。以上功能无法截图到剪贴板同时提供编辑功能，此外录屏功能也是缺失的，所以安装第三方截图软件势在必行。</p><p>说出来可能有点 low，其实我截屏和录屏一直是用 QQ 内嵌的截图功能。对，就是腾讯那个 QQ。简单来说，QQ 这个截图工具是可以单独运行的，并不依赖 QQ 的运行，我把这个工具按上一条「简单管理启动项」中的方法设置为开机自启。这样不用管 QQ 的死活就可以一直使用它了。</p><p>步骤是：</p><ul><li>打开 QQ &gt; <code>Cmd + ,</code> 进入设置 &gt; <code>Function</code> &gt; 点 <code>Capture &amp; Record Screen</code> 右边的 <code>Preferences</code>，这时显示下面的设置界面：</li></ul><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/08/04/1564911840.png" alt=""></p><ul><li>设置好你想要的截屏快捷键和录屏快捷键，并确保<code>Runs in background after you quit QQ</code> 勾选上了。</li><li>在 Applications 的 QQ.app 上右键再点 <code>Show Package Contents</code>，然后按如下路径找到 <code>QQ jietu plugin.app</code>，最后将它拖进 Login Items 即可：</li></ul><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/08/04/1564912051.png" alt=""></p><p>至此，按下之前设置的截图快捷键，会出现 Screenshot，Screen Recording 和 Recognition 三个选项，分别是截屏、录屏、识别图片中的文本，功能还算够用的。</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/08/04/1564912278.png" alt=""></p><h4 id="Finder"><a href="#Finder" class="headerlink" title="Finder"></a>Finder</h4><p>关于 Finder，有一下几点建议：</p><ul><li>在 Finder 的设置中，将 <code>New Finder windows show</code> 改为使用频率最高的目录，比如 Download 或个人工作目录：</li></ul><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/08/04/1564912792.png" alt=""></p><ul><li>在 Finder 的设置中，将搜索设置为搜索当前目录 (默认居然是搜索整个 Mac 😢)：</li></ul><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/08/04/1564913032.png" alt=""></p><ul><li>在浏览目录或文件时，建议用下面的视图</li></ul><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/08/04/1564913106.png" alt=""></p><ul><li>建议多使用 Tab 标签页，而不是打开新的 Finder 窗口。</li></ul><h3 id="对程序员"><a href="#对程序员" class="headerlink" title="对程序员"></a>对程序员</h3><p>以下是面向程序员的内容<del>，非战斗人员请速速撤退</del>。</p><h4 id="Terminal"><a href="#Terminal" class="headerlink" title="Terminal"></a>Terminal</h4><p>网上很多文章一上来就是 <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTerm2</a>，不过我倒是觉得 macOS 自带的 Terminal 已经够强大了，并且字体更好看点，再说本着能用系统自带就不用第三方，我就一直默认使用 Terminal。</p><p>macOS 上 Terminal 窗口默认太小了，我们可以在其设置 &gt; Profiles &gt; Window &gt; Window Size 中设置更大的行列数，从而充分利用我们的屏幕，省去拖拽窗口边缘的行为。</p><p>如果时常使用 Terminal，以下快捷键是非常 Life Saving 的：</p><div class="table-container"><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">快捷键</th><th style="text-align:center">作用</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">Ctrl + U</td><td style="text-align:center">清除已输入的内容</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Ctrl + A</td><td style="text-align:center">光标移动到行首</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Ctrl + E</td><td style="text-align:center">光标移动到行末</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Ctrl + K</td><td style="text-align:center">删除光标之后的内容</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>细心的读者可能会发现上面快捷键都是使用反人类的 Ctrl 而不是 Mac 上的 Cmd，其实上面的快捷键历史非常悠久 (那时可能还没有苹果公司)，是从早期 Unix 系统流传下来，所以同样适用于 Linux (可能会有细微差别)。另外，之前「光标要快」讲的按住 Option 时按左右方向键来快速移动光标，在此同样适用。</p><p>顺带说下可能大家不知道的两个非常有用的命令，file 和 type。前者可根据文件 meta data 判断文件类型，后者可告知你一个命令是以下来源中的哪一种：内建命令 (比如 type, cd 等)、指定路径下的可执行文件、符号链接。另外如果电脑中不小心有两个某命令(比如两个 python)且都加入了 PATH 环境变量，<code>type xxx</code> 会显示当前使用的 xxx 的路径，而 <code>which -a xxx</code> 则显示所有已加入 PATH 环境变量 的 xxx。</p><h4 id="Oh-My-Zsh"><a href="#Oh-My-Zsh" class="headerlink" title="Oh My Zsh"></a>Oh My Zsh</h4><p><a href="https://ohmyz.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oh My Zsh</a> 是久负盛名的开源项目，它几乎让 macOS 中 Zsh 的上手难度变为了 0。首先啰嗦一下，macOS 一直使用 bash 作为默认 Shell，这也是常见 Linux 发行版的做法。</p><p>我个人最喜欢 On My Zsh 的一下特性：</p><ul><li>按已输入文本搜索历史命令。大家都知道 bash 中按向上方向键可以一条条显示历史命令，而 On My Zsh 则可以比如输入 <code>adb shell</code> 后按向上方向键，显示的全部是 <code>adb shell</code> 开头的历史命令，这让我们更快找到想要的历史命令。</li><li>更简单的目录选择。比如输入 ls 后，按 tab 键，会显示当前目录所有 item，然后可以直接按上方向键选中 item 再按回车确认。</li><li>如果当前目录在 Git 项目中，会显示当前分支，以及是否有未提交改动的小叉叉。</li><li>更丰富的高亮色和主题定制功能。</li></ul><p>如果上面有你想要功能，请自行安装 😁</p><h4 id="Homebrew"><a href="#Homebrew" class="headerlink" title="Homebrew"></a>Homebrew</h4><p><a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebrew</a> 是又一个上万 star 的开源项目，大家可能早就知道了它，所以我就只简单说说。</p><p>Homebrew 自称是 macOS 上缺失的包管理器，的确如此，Linux 发行版有各种管理命令行软件包的包管理器，而 macOS 默认没有。</p><p>Homebrew 的 <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">core repo</a> 为每个包维护一个 ruby 脚本文件，改文件记录了这个包的依赖信息，版本更迭信息，从哪里获取 binary 包或者源代码、编译方法等等信息。有了这些信息，Homebrew 就可以管理包的安装(包括下载源码编译的方式)、升级、卸载、依赖下载等，也就实现了包管理器的功能。这个 core repo 在我们本地也有一份，Homebrew 的 updating 其实本地的 repo pull 远程的变化，也就是这些 ruby 脚本的增删改给 pull 过来。软件包的名字是唯一性的，因而上述 ruby 脚本直接以软件包的名字命名，也是不会重复的。</p><p>值得一提的是，Homebrew 把 core repo 和后面讲到的 cask repo 叫做 tap，而 tap 里面管理的依赖包，叫做 formula，了解这些术语有利于看懂 Homebrew 的提示。</p><p>Homebrew 安装软件包，通常是在 <code>/usr/local</code> 目录中以该软件包名字为名建立目录，然后其中再以版本号为名建立目录，版本号目录中含有该版本的所有文件，且往往有个 bin 目录来包含软件包的可执行文件。也就是说，Homebrew 可以同事维护多个版本。而真正加入到 PATH 环境变量的其实是 <code>/usr/local/bin</code> 目录。Homebrew 每更新或安装一个软件包，<code>/usr/local/bin</code> 中都会更新或新建一个符号链接，来指向此软件包最新的版本的真正可执行文件。从而我们执行此符号链接，就可以运行最新的软件包。</p><p>Homebrew 管理的命令行软件，很多是 GNU 开源软件，这些软件的分发在国内有不少镜像，从而能加快我们的下载速度。为此，core repo 在国内也有镜像 (比如<a href="http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/help/brew.git.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">中国科大的镜像</a>)，只不过这个镜像并非和 Homebrew 官方的 repo 完全一致，而是下载链接指向国内的一些软件源镜像，也只有这样才能真正加快下载软件包的速度。</p><p>此外，Homebrew 也支持一些 GUI 软件 (如 Google Chrome 和 Sublime Text 等) 的管理。GUI 软件的管理，是由 <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cask repo</a> 来支撑的。使用 Homebrew 安装 GUI 软件，通常也会在 <code>/usr/local/bin</code> 中新建符号链接来，使我们可以在 Shell 中启动 GUI 软件。比如 Sublime Text 安装好后，就会有 subl 这个符号链接：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/08/04/1564931295.png" alt=""></p><p>我们直接执行 <code>subl</code> 即可打开 Sublime Text，而 <code>subl</code> 加上文件名，还可打开指定文件。</p><h4 id="正则表达式"><a href="#正则表达式" class="headerlink" title="正则表达式"></a>正则表达式</h4><p>正则表达式在我们搜索、替换结构复杂的文本时非常有用。过去，程序员只能用 grep 和 sed 命令来使用正则表达式查找、替换文本，而现在，许多 IDE 和文本编辑器都支持在查找和替换时使用正则表达式。</p><h4 id="最后的最后"><a href="#最后的最后" class="headerlink" title="最后的最后"></a>最后的最后</h4><p>效率，在日常生活中是指同样时间内完成工作的多少。追求效率是无可厚非的，然而处在这样一个快节奏的现代社会中，有时候我们也需要慢下来，悠然和缓的操持我们的电脑，享受任务完成后的一刻宁静<del>，不然别人以为交给我们的任务太简单了</del>。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4 id="背景"><a href="#背景" class="headerlink" title="背景"></a>背景</h4><p>前天公司发给我一部三星 tablet 作为测试机，是 Tab S4 wifi 版，具体型号是 SM-T830，虽然不是我期待的 Pixel 3 XL，但是配置也还不错，加上屏幕也比较大。但是坑就坑在，这是一部国行的机器，没有 Google Mobile Service (GMS) 不说，还充斥了不少国内生态的杂物，比如系统设置中的 device storage 界面，居然写着「powered by 360」，还有一些预装的国内应用。</p><p>这时摆在我前面的有三种方法：第一，刷机刷入一个原生 Android 系统，这当然是最完美的；第二，找一个三星官方的但是是国外版的系统刷入，这种系统会有 GMS；第三，自己把确实的 Google 服务安装上去，凑活着用。</p><p>以上第一种方法，我在网上查了查，几乎不可能，因为这个 机型比较小众，网上根本没有给它刷原生系统的方法，就连 <a href="https://lineageos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LineageOS</a> 也没有支持这个机型。第二种方法，是比较可行的，这款 tablet 即使小众，也是在全球销售的，国外绝大部分地区销售的都是带有 GMS 的，此外这是个 WiFi 版机型，也不用担心运营商和网络制式的问题，所以刷成功的话，虽不是原生 Android，但也有完整可靠的 GMS 全件套。第三种方法，改动最小，但是也可能有后遗症，因为这样自行补充安装 Google service 的方式有可能是不完备可靠的，指不定啥时候就出点 bug。</p><p>所以我就开始实施第二种方法：刷入三星官方固件的国外版本，最后这件事折腾了我一天多。</p><h4 id="下载-错误的-固件包"><a href="#下载-错误的-固件包" class="headerlink" title="下载 (错误的) 固件包"></a>下载 (错误的) 固件包</h4><p>首先是获取固件包，在网上找了一通，找到了 xda 上的<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-tab-s4/how-to/sm-t830-t830xxu1arh1-t3831918" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这个帖子</a>，里面贴出了存放在 Google drive 的适用于 SM-T830 的两个官方固件的链接，一个是法国版，另一个是阿拉伯联合酋长国版。帖子的作者还说，他对刷机可能出现的后果不负任何责任，提供这两个包只是让大家免收一些网站要收费才能下载固件包或者是付费才能提速下载的恶心。话说，SM-T830 的小众，从我搜遍 xda 也没找到几个和它相关的帖子即可略见一斑。</p><p>固件包大小约是 3.6 GB，起先我从浏览器直接下载 Google drive 上的固件包，网速很慢只有 100KB/S 的样子，下了挺久最后都失败了。后面我发现，先把固件添加到我自己的 Google drive 空间，然后在手机上的 Google drive 应用中下载，配合公司的网络环境，速度可以很快，差不多半个小时就下载好了。</p><h4 id="企图用虚拟机，失败"><a href="#企图用虚拟机，失败" class="headerlink" title="企图用虚拟机，失败"></a>企图用虚拟机，失败</h4><p>三星的内部刷机工具 odin，只能用 Windows 运行，我手里只有 Mac，所以我一开始希望用 virtual box 中的 win10 虚拟机来操作。我从硬盘里面把很久前备份的 win10 的 virtual disk image (也就是一个 .vdi 文件) 拷贝到电脑，然后以此新建一个虚拟机，成功的运行，但是鼓捣了半天，也无法让这个虚拟机连接 USB 设备，别说这台 tablet 不行，连 U 盘都不行。VirtualBox VM Extension Pack 安装了，在 win10 里面也安装了 Guest Additions，USB device filters 也配置了，就是不行，只能放弃，找同事借用 Windows 台式机。</p><p><strong>2019年1月1日更新</strong>：我后面 VirtualBox 装 Windows 虚拟机是可以连接到 Android 设备的，并且可以刷机，见<a href="https://tao93.top/2019/01/01/%E7%BB%99%E4%B8%89%E6%98%9F%20tablet%20SM-T830%20%E5%88%B7%E6%9C%BA[%E7%BB%AD]/">给三星 tablet SM-T830 刷机[续]</a> 的最后一部分</p><h4 id="失败的刷机"><a href="#失败的刷机" class="headerlink" title="失败的刷机"></a>失败的刷机</h4><p>在同事的台式机上操作之前，我在网上已经看了一段讲解刷机过程的视频，感觉挺简单的，就几个步骤而已。等到开始在 Windows 上面开始弄，我把固件包解压，然后用 odin 开始，这才发现那个视频其实过时了，视频中固件包解压后只有一个文件，但是我解压后其实有 4 个文件。其实这一点 Odin 中都已经提示了，new model 需要 4 个文件：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2018/12/08/1544280785.png" alt=""></p><p>所以我的固件包是比较新的，所以有多个文件，但是仔细对比发现有点问题，odin 需要的是 BL, AP, CP, HOME_CSC 4 部分，但是我的固件包解压后 4 个文件的文件名是如下所示 (文件我已经删掉了，所以没法贴出完整文件名)：</p><blockquote><p>BL…<br>AP…<br>CSC…<br>HOME_CSC…</p></blockquote><p>相当于没有 CP 开头的，反而似乎有两个 CSC 的，这时我也没夺多管，依次点击 odin 中的 BL, AP, CP, CSC 四个安装，然后把 4 个文件都添加进去，然后就点 start 了，然后就失败了。于是我把 CP 和 CSC 需要的文件调换了一下，还是失败。</p><p>这时候我就查了一下为啥少了 CP 开头的文件，这才发现，原来 WiFi 版就是没有 CP 文件，这是和基带相关的，只有可插卡上网的版本才有。顺便也发现了我的 CSC… 和 HOME_CSC… 两个文件的区别，据说前者是彻底清空数据，后者会保留用户数据，所以这两个文件其实作用是类似的，其实我也注意到它们大小也非常相近，都是 180MB 左右。</p><p>于是我就空出 CP 那里不添加文件，其余 3 个添加上，然后 start，结果左边文本框停留在 ‘setupconnection..’，我一查，发现很多说卡在这一步的，纷纷在求 help。没办法我就只能继续查，有说要先运行 odin 后连接 USB 数据线的(试了不行)。查了一阵，终于查到一个看起来比较靠谱的<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/sprint-galaxy-s6/help/odin-stuck-setupconnection-t3574320" target="_blank" rel="noopener">方法</a>，依然是 xda 论坛上的：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2018/12/08/1544281510.png" alt=""></p><p>我按照上面说的一步一步走，依然失败，但是没再卡在 setupconnection 了。我总结发现，odin 应该确实有 bug，明明设备连接正常，它就是卡在这一步，这时候可以这么做：1. 重新启动设备，1. 断开 USB 连接，3. 进入 downloading mode，4. 连接 USB 然后再在 odin 中 start，就不会卡在那一步了。</p><p>进入 Download 模式的方法：先关机，然后同时按住 Volumn Up 和 Power 键，等屏幕亮后立即松手，此时会进入 Recovery mode (三星自己的 recovery 或者第三方 recovery 比如 TWRP)。如果是三星的 recovery，选择 boot to bootloader 即可，如果是 TWRP，选择进入 Download 模式即可。</p><p>回到刚刚说的，虽然没卡在 setupconnection 了，但是依然失败，提示大概是：</p><blockquote><p><id:0 004=""> abl.elf</id:0></p><p><id:0 004=""> FAIL! (Auth)</id:0></p><id:0 004=""><p><id:0 004=""> Complete(Write) operation failed.</id:0></p><p><osm> All threads completed. (succeed 0 / failed 1)</osm></p></id:0></blockquote><p>以 abl.elf 为关键字又是一番在网上搜索，最后发现<a href="http://bbs.gfan.com/android-9245022-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这个帖子有</a>人遇到这个问题最后解决了：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2018/12/08/1544281993.png" alt=""></p><p>起初我对「固件版本落后于现有版本」这句话不以为然，因为我觉得这不就意味着只能升级不能降级嘛，不科学。但后面我忽然想到，这句话意思可能是刷机不能刷那些版本比设备出厂时系统版本还更旧的固件，就上这个人确实解决了问题，并且我前面下的固件包都是 2018 年 8 月份的，确实有点旧，所以我开始想怎么下最新的用于 SM-T830 的固件。</p><h4 id="下载最新的固件包"><a href="#下载最新的固件包" class="headerlink" title="下载最新的固件包"></a>下载最新的固件包</h4><p>这时，就又回到开始找固件包的步骤了，网上满是假链接，或者是要注册，要交费的，找得人心累。不过，最后竟然找到一个叫 SamFirm tool 的神器，这个神器可以直接高速下载想要的最新固件，简直不能更棒。如下图所示，输入系统型号，然后选择 auto 模式来查找，就能找到最新的固件，并且下载速度还很快！<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-tab-s/general/tool-samfirm-samsung-firmware-t2988647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这个帖子</a>可以下载到这个神器。</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2018/12/08/1544283275.png" alt=""></p><p>如上图所示，准确地填入型号，填入要下载的固件的国家或地区代号（这里我要填的就是某个外国或国外地区，这样固件包才会有 GMS）。这个国家或地区代号可以从<a href="https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares/galaxy-tab-s4/SM-T830/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这里</a>找到，我在上一张图中填入的是 XEF，其实就是代表法国。填好后勾选 Auto，然后点击 Check Update，即可检查到最新固件包的信息，我在今天（2018年12月8日）检查到的 SM-T830 的法国版最新固件包如上图箭头所示，是 2018年10月24日更新的。然后就可以在 SamFirm 右边点下载了。建议勾选 Decrypt automatically，否则 下载好固件包后还需要重新解密，费时间。</p><p>国家或地区代号截图：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2018/12/08/1544283882.png" alt=""></p><h4 id="成功刷机"><a href="#成功刷机" class="headerlink" title="成功刷机"></a>成功刷机</h4><p>下载到最新固件后，解压，然后用 odin 依次填入 BL AP CSC 三个地方的文件，点 start，继续卡在 setupconnection，按照我之前的总结跳过这个 setupconnection，然后真正开始刷机，大概 10 分钟不到就刷好了。</p><h4 id="写在最后"><a href="#写在最后" class="headerlink" title="写在最后"></a>写在最后</h4><p>刷个机遇到的坑还真是挺多，把这些记录下来，说不定以后公司的国行设备需要刷机，这些记录就能派上用场了。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最近的做的一项 feature 中，需要使用类似于 iOS 的 UIPickerView 的控件，功能是通过滚动 item 来选择其中一个，也就是下图这样的：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/04/07/1554640301.png" alt=""></p><p>Android SDK 倒是有一个 NumberPicker 和这个非常类似，不过 NumberPicker 设计有点问题，滚动很慢，即使是手指快速滑动，也只能滚动五六个 items，而 Github 上确实有不少优秀的实现，可以和 iOS 的 UIPickerView 非常相似，不过其代码有些复杂，以至于想要速读代码然后自己写一份也比较费时间。所以，我就想到自己基于 Android 的 ListView 写一个简单的自定义 PickerView。</p><p>既然使用 ListView，那么首先需要解决问题有如下几个：</p><ol><li>如何让所有 item 都能通过滑动而滚动到视图中间，从而表示该 item 被选中？</li><li>如果让 ListView 的 idle 状态变为离散的，而非本来的任意滚动状态都可以为 idle？</li><li>怎么获取当前选中的 item 的序号？</li></ol><p>第一个问题比较好办，在 list 的首尾各填充一些空白的 item，这样就能让用户可见的所有 item 都能滑动到正中间。第二个问题，我的做法是，如果手指离开时，ListView 缓慢滑动，那么就在速度低于某个阈值时，让它滑动到恰好将一些 item 显示出来而不要有某个 item 只显示一部分；而如果手指离开时 ListView 快速滑动，那么就在 ListView 刚刚变为 idle 状态时，让它就近滑动到「恰好将一些 item 显示出来」的状态。第三个问题好办，计算一下当前显示的所有 item 的 position 就能知道最中间显示的 item 的 position。</p><p>另外还有一些细节问题：</p><ol><li>需要在中间绘制上两条灰色水平线；</li><li>需要在 canvas 的最上层绘制不是正中间区域绘制半透明矩形，从而让非选中的 item 看起来是灰色的；</li><li>点击非选中的 item 时，需要滚动 ListView 让该 item 滑动到正中间。</li></ol><p>实现的代码如下：</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span

线程抛出了未捕获的异常时，JVM 先会调用到 UncaughtExceptionHandler，然后再会把此线程停止掉。所以这段代码中，如果主线程抛出异常，那么第 6 行的方法结束后，主线程就会被 JVM 给停止掉，既然主线程都停止掉了，那自然就无响应了，也就会发生 ANR 了。</p><p>事实上，一般我们设置自定义 UncaughtExceptionHandler 时，都会在自定义的 uncaughtException 方法最后再调用一遍被我们顶替掉的系统默认的 UncaughtExceptionHandler，以便把应用 kill 掉，而这个例子，充分的显示了，当未捕获异常发生后，就算赖着不 kill 掉应用也是不行的，因为可能主线程都已经被停掉了。</p><p>关于 JVM 先调用 UncaughtExceptionHandler

    <updated>2019-07-05T14:04:33.387Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>事情的起因是，从 xda 上面<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-tab-s4/help/lineage-development-t3852509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这个帖子</a> 看到，有人在三星 Tab S4 平板上面刷了个类原生 Android 的系统，他表示用起来挺好，只不过 4 个扬声器只有底部两个可以发声。看到这个我心里就痒痒，因为三星的官方 rom 我并不喜欢，里面有三星的 app store，还有三星的一套账户系统，调试到系统代码的时候，行号也完全对不上(Pixel是可以对上行号的)，所以我也想给手里的 Tab S4 平板刷一个类原生系统。</p><p>然后我就在 xda 上面查了查，发现我应该需要先刷入一个 TWRP recovery，然后再使用 TWRP 刷入类原生系统。另外我也注意到，之所以能刷并没有适配 Tab S4 的 ROM，得归功于 Project Trable。谷歌提出 Project Trable 是为了让 Android 系统的开发和底层驱动的开发分离开，两者只要满足协议，就可以组合在一起，这样就可减小 Android 系统升级时厂商开发驱动的工作，从而让设备更快升级 Android 系统。Project Trable 也使得那些符合要求的设备，可以刷大量满足 Project Trable 要求的 General System Image (GSI)。Tab S4 就是符合 Project Trable 要求的，所以我就是要给它刷 GSI。</p><p>回到前面说的 TWRP 的事情，TWRP 官方并没有适配 Tab S4 的版本，不过我在<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-tab-s4/development/recovery-twrp-3-2-3-1-galaxy-tab-s4-t3843211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这个帖子</a>里面发现了用于 Tab S4 的非官方 TWRP，并写出了步骤：</p><ol><li>确认 OEM 已解锁；</li><li>设备进入 download 模式；</li><li>使用 odin 的 AP slot 来刷入 TWRP 压缩包，记得要取消勾选「Auto Reboot」;</li><li>关机，然后再进入 TWRP；</li><li>进入 TWRP，然后刷入 Forced encryption disabler patch，format DATA 一下；</li><li>进入 TWRP，刷入 Magisk 压缩包，于是设备就 root 了。</li></ol><p>步骤其实很简单，不过我在这里折腾了 3 天。我先按照上面的步骤来，结果发现进 TWRP 后就无法访问 internal storage，自然就刷不了 Forced encryption disabler patch。我试了非常多想法，比如重刷三星官方固件，刷更旧的官方固件(原因是这个帖子里面工具发出来时，官方固件还更旧一些，而我看到这帖子时已经更新到比较新了)，刷国行的官方固件，都不行，其中刷更低版本的固件还有限制即 BootLoader 不能降级，所以其实官方固件降不了多少级。我还看到了<a href="https://www.thecustomdroid.com/install-twrp-samsung-galaxy-tab-s4-root-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这种帖子</a>，里面告诉我说，需要先刷一个 DM-Verity patched boot，我也试了，发现刷完这个 DM-Verity patched boot 后直接无法进入系统，报 Verification Failed 错误，必须重置设备才行。翻遍 xda 那个 40 几页的帖子后，我发现其实这个帖子就是抄 xda 那个帖子，只不过抄的时候，xda 帖子上面的步骤确实第一步是刷 DM-Verity patched boot，不过后来 xda 帖子步骤更新了，成了现在这样的。</p><p>不是无法访问 internal storage 嘛，后来我买了个 micro SD 卡，插进设备，在 TWRP 中这个 micro SD 是可以访问的，所以我就可以继续刷入 Forced encryption disabler patch 并 format DATA，然后我就 boot loop 了，真气人。即使我再刷入 GSI，依然是 boot loop。</p><p>后来那个 xda 帖子的作者回复我说「全程没看到我刷 Magisk 的描述，但 Magisk 是必要的，否则会 boot loop」。我确实没刷 Magisk，因为我并没有像 root，我只想搞个 TWRP 然后刷 GSI 而已。于是我就刷了 Magisk，发现不在 boot loop 了，然后再<a href="https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/releases/tag/v108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这里</a> 下载了 system-arm64-aonly-gapps-su.img.xz 这个 GSI 并刷入，这次终于成功了，进入了一个类似 AOSP user-debug 类型的 aosp 系统，很简陋，连 Contact，Settings，等这些应用都是 aosp 版本的，和正常的很不一样，相机应用则直接打开就 crash。顺便记录一下 TWRP 刷 GSI 的方法，很简单：</p><ol><li>进入 TWRP，wipe 一下；</li><li>进入 install，切换到 install image 模式，找到 GSI；</li><li>partition 选择 system image，flash；</li><li>重启</li></ol><p>关键是，这个 aosp 系统有些 bug，最受不了的 bug 是，锁屏、旋转时屏幕都会变形一下，截屏得到的图片也是会变形一下。这和我最初看到的 xda 帖子里面那人说的只是扬声器没有全部发声差远了。所以我就想找更好些的 GSI。问了那个人，结果没回复我。</p><p>最后找到了 <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/project-treble/trebleenabled-device-development/9-0-pixelexperience-p-t3833294" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixel Experience</a> ，虽然依然有一些 bug，不过感觉还可以。</p><p>放几张截图：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/01/01/1546351524.png" alt=""></p><p>最后还有一点，这次我是用 Virtual Box 中的 Win 10 虚拟机刷的，让 VirtualBox 中的 Win 10 虚拟机连接上 Android 设备，需要给 VirtualBox 安装 extension pack，在 Win 10 虚拟机中安装 guest additions，然后还需要在此 win 10 虚拟机的设置中添加对应的 USB filter (需要设备连接上后才能添加)，并按照 USB 类型勾选 USB 2.0 还是 3.0，如下图所示：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/01/01/1546352547.png" alt=""></p><p>最后，在设备连接上电脑后，把 win 10 的窗口放在最前面，然后再 macOS 的菜单栏勾选对应的 USB device，勾选的话，就是 win 10 虚拟机连接词 USB 设备，否则驾驶 macOS 连接此 USB device，如下图：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/01/01/1546353760.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>2019 年 5 月 29 日更新</strong></p><p>最近得知三星已经给一些设备推送了 Android Pie 的更新，而组里面几部 Tab S4 都是运行国内版系统的国行机器，所以没有收到更新通知，所以我就有了把我手里的 Tab S4 刷回基于 Android Pie 的国外版三星系统。</p><p>步骤很简单，先用 SamFirm tool 下载基于 Android Pie 的 stock firmware 包，然后设备先进入 TWRP recovery (我之前刷了 TWRP，所以有这个)，然后点 Reboot 再点 Download 即可进入三星设备的 Download 模式，然后就是很简单地使用 odin 工具把系统刷进去就好了。</p><p>注意 Download 模式和 Recovery 是不一样的。TWRP 是 custom recovery，而三星自带的 recovery 是类似下面这样的:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/05/29/1559062868.png" alt=""></p><p>即使用 TWRP 取代了自带的 Recovery，我们依然可以进入 Download 模式，从而用 odin 刷回到官方 firmware。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Toast 是 Android 系统一种非常简单的提示性小工具，最近我尝试修复 Toast 相关的两种 Crash，所以把相关的原委和过程记录了下来。先来看一下第一种 Crash 的 log:</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td

是没有任何 app 代码牵涉其中的，所以无法确定是 app 何处的代码导致的这个 crash。我们先来看看 Toast 显示的大致过程。</p><p>首先是通过 <code>Toast#makeText</code> 方法或者 <code>Toast</code> 构造函数创建 Toast 对象，然后就可以调用它的 show 方法了。不过此方法是异步的，它仅仅是将该 toast 添加到一个队列中，等待显示，即此方法不等 toast 真正显示就已经返回了，而 toast 的显示需要用一个新的 UI 线程消息中的代码来显示出来。</p><p><code>Toast#show</code> 方法：</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span

方法，就可以复现 crash。复现思路是，先让前一个 toast 把 view 添加到 WindowManager，但要让它添加失败，然后第二次另一个 toast 再添加此 view，此次发生 crash，这个思路也是按照前面的猜想来的。首先，上面的代码是将同一个 view 添加到不同的 toast 对象去 show，当添加到第一个 toast 调用 show 方法后，主线程 sleep 1980 毫秒，这个时间是很微妙的，接近 2000 毫秒但是却略少。这个时间可以使得主线程醒来时，toast 的 token 即将失效。不能用更长的 sleep 时间是因为那样的话，主线程还在 sleep 中 token 已失效，token 的失效是在 NotificationManagerService 中产生的，失效后，NotificationManagerService 会处理 MESSAGE_DURATION_REACHED 消息，最终会跨进程调用到 Toast#TN#hide 方法，而这个方法会让我们 app 的主线程消息队列增加一个 HIDE 消息：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/01/11/1547217156.png" alt=""></p><p>如此一来，当主线程 sleep 结束执行 Toast#TN#handleShow 方法时，就会因消息队列已有 HIDE 消息而提前返回:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/01/11/1547217419.png" alt=""></p><p>既然都提前返回了，view 也就不会被第一个 toast 添加到 WindowManager，那么也就不符合我们的思路中「让第一个 toast 把 view 添加到 WindowManager 是发生异常」的想法。</p><p>所以，需要 1980 毫秒这样一个时间，这个时间使得主线程醒来执行到第一个 toast 的 Toast#TN#handleShow 时，token 还没失效，所以 handleShow 方法不会提前返回，所以 view 会继续往 WindowManager 添加，但是 20 毫秒不足以让这个添加顺利完成，相反，很可能添加时 token 失效了， 于是添加失败，发生第一种 crash 的 BadTokenException (Anddroid 8 以上此异常会被捕获，前文已描述)，这样就符合我们的思路了。下面截图证明了确实发生了 BadTokenException：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/01/11/1547217762.png" alt=""></p><p>至此，按照前面的思路，此 view 将会无 parent，但是却留在了 WindowManagerGlobal 的 mViews 中，却又不在 mDyingViews 中，于是，当再次按下按钮，执行另一个 toast 添加此 view 的代码时，WindowManagerGlobal#addView 中将发生 IllegalStateException，crash 也就复现了，截图为证：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2019/01/11/1547217909.png" alt=""></p><p>至此，toast crash 的分析算是有了一个比较完满的结尾。对于本文中 2019 年 1 月 11 日更新的部分，在此感谢刘成同学提供的帮助，他本来用来复现问题的方式是「先调一个 toast 的 show，sleep 三四秒，然后再用同一个 view 调另一个 toast 的 show」，这个方式因为前面讲的原因而无法复现 crash，但却给了我灵感，让我想到了 1980 毫秒这个时间，最终成功复现了 crash。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>让我们先从位于 android.graphics 包中的 Bitmap 类的一个方法开始说起，也就是 createBitmap(Bitmap source, int x, int y, int width, int height, Matrix m, boolean filter) 这样一个方法。这个方法中有个矩阵参数，通过传入此矩阵参数，可以将 source Bitmap 经过一定的转换再创建目标 Bitmap。那么这个矩阵是怎么起作用的呢？先看一段示例代码：</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Matrix matrix = <span class="keyword">new</span> Matrix();</span><br><span class="line">matrix.postRotate(<span class="number">90</span>);</span><br><span class="line">Bitmap bitmap2 = Bitmap.createBitmap(bitmap1, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, bitmap1.width(), bitmap1.getHeight(), matrix, <span class="keyword">true</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>上述代码做的事情是将 bitmap1 顺时针旋转 90° 得到 bitmap2，起关键作用的就是这个 matrix。第一行代码会得到一个 3×3 的单位矩阵，而第二行代码之后，矩阵将会变成下面这样：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">  \begin{bmatrix}   0 & -1 & 0 \\   1 & 0 & 0 \\   0 & 0 & 1  \end{bmatrix} ·  \begin{bmatrix}   1 & 0 & 0 \\   0 & 1 & 0 \\   0 & 0 & 1  \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix}  0 & -1 & 0 \\  1 & 0 & 0 \\  0 & 0 & 1  \end{bmatrix}</script><p>注意在 xy 平面内顺时针 rotate 90° 的操作对应的矩阵是 </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix}cos 90° & -sin 90° & 0 \\sin 90° & cos90° & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}   0 & -1 & 0 \\   1 & 0 & 0 \\   0 & 0 & 1  \end{bmatrix}</script><p>记上面的矩阵为 R90，记上面代码中的 matrix 为 M，记单位矩阵为 I，那么第 2 行的操作则是等同于下面的表达式：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">M = R90·M</script><p>也就是:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">M = R90·I</script><p>注意上面的点乘顺序是 R90 在前，I 在后（虽然这里 R90·I 和 I·R90 结果是一样，但别的场景未必如此）。原因是 代码中是 <code>postRotate</code> 方法，这里 <code>post</code> 表示是把 rotate 放在变换的最后一步。而变换矩阵作用 R90·M 作用在目标向量 V 时，将会是表达式：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">R90·M·V</script><p>这样就可以理解为是先 M·V 然后这个结果再被 R90 乘，所以是先做 M 本来的变换，然后再做 R90 的变换，也就是 rotate 90° 在最后一步。这也就是第 2 行代码的 postRotate 90° 等价于 M = R90·M 也就是 M = R90·I 的原因。</p><p>所以第 3 行代码传入的 matrix 就是：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix}   0 & -1 & 0 \\   1 & 0 & 0 \\   0 & 0 & 1  \end{bmatrix}</script><p>现在我们进入前面说的 createBitmap 这个方法中去看看源码是怎么实现这个变换的：</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> Bitmap <span class="title">createBitmap</span><span class="params">(Bitmap source, <span class="keyword">int</span> x, <span class="keyword">int</span> y, <span class="keyword">int</span> width, <span class="keyword">int</span> height, Matrix m, <span class="keyword">boolean</span> filter)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    ...</span><br><span class="line">    Rect srcR = <span class="keyword">new</span> Rect(x, y, x + width, y + height);</span><br><span class="line">    RectF dstR = <span class="keyword">new</span> RectF(<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, width, height);</span><br><span class="line">    RectF deviceR = <span class="keyword">new</span> RectF();</span><br><span class="line">    m.mapRect(deviceR, dstR);</span><br><span class="line">    neww = Math.round(deviceR.width());</span><br><span class="line">    newh = Math.round(deviceR.height());</span><br><span class="line">    bitmap = createBitmap(neww, newh, transformedConfig, transformed || source.hasAlpha());</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    Canvas canvas = <span class="keyword">new</span> Canvas(bitmap);</span><br><span class="line">    canvas.translate(-deviceR.left, -deviceR.top);</span><br><span class="line">    canvas.concat(m);</span><br><span class="line">    canvas.drawBitmap(source, srcR, dstR, paint);</span><br><span class="line">    ...</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> bitmap;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>上面代码第 3 行 srcR 将是 source Bitmap 中要被转换的部分。而 dstR 是同样宽高但是左上角在 (0, 0) 的矩形。第 6 行则是将 dstR 变换后得到 deviceR，根据前面所知 的 m 的值，可知deviceR 将会是 left, top, right, bottom 分别是 -height, 0, 0, width:</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2018/12/04/1543937277.png" alt=""></p><p>即 deviceR 是 dstR 绕原点顺时针旋转 90° 得到的。紧接着代码 7、8 行得到转换后的 Bitmap 的宽高。然后第 9 行以此宽高创建了新的 Bitmap。第 11 行基于此 Bitmap 创建了 canvas。</p><p>重点来了，第 12 行对此 canvas 进行平移变换，平移的目的是让 deviceR 的左上角移动到原点。从而让它位于 x 非负且 y 非负的象限。而第 13 行则将 m 矩阵的变换作用在此 canvas 是。需要注意的是，第 12、13 行的变换，都是 pre 的变换而不是 post 的。所以可以看成 13 行的变换其实是比第 12 行的平移先执行的，也就是整个变换过程可理解为先绕原点顺时针旋转 90°，然后再将左上角平移到原点，这样就成功的完成了将原 Bitmap 旋转 90° 并创建新 Bitmap 的操作，虽然这里除了 rotate，其实还利用了 translation 操作。</p><p>用 3×3 矩阵在 xy 平面内变换，可以分为 translate, rotate, scale, skew 一共 4 种，表示这四种操作的矩阵分别记作：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">T(a, b),\ R(\theta),\ S(u, v),\ SKx(\theta), SKy(\theta)</script><p>那么它们分别是：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix}   1 & 0 & a \\   0 & 1 & b \\   0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix},\ \begin{bmatrix}   cos(\theta) & -sin(\theta) & 0 \\   sin(\theta) & cos(\theta) & 0 \\   0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix},\ \begin{bmatrix}   u & 0 & 0 \\   0 & v & 0 \\   0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix},\ \begin{bmatrix}   1 & tan(\theta) & 0 \\   0 & 1 & 0 \\   0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix},\ \begin{bmatrix}   1 & 0 & 0 \\   tan(\theta) & 1 & 0 \\   0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}</script><p>分别表示的含义是：</p><ol><li>向 +x 方向平移 a 且向 +y 方向平移 b；</li><li>以原点为中心在 xy 平面旋转 theta 角度；</li><li>以原点为 pivot，x 方向和 y 方向分别伸缩值为 u 和 v 的比例；</li><li>每个点的 $x$ 坐标变为 $x + y·tan(\theta)$，而 $y$ 坐标不变，视觉表现为图形向 +y 方向倾斜，倾斜角度为 $\theta$;</li><li>每个点的 $y$ 坐标变为 $x·tan(\theta) + y$，而 $x$ 坐标不变，视觉表现为图形向 +x 方向倾斜，倾斜角度为 $\theta$.</li></ol><p>注意, $T(a, 0)$ 和 $T(0, b)$ 组合起来的变换，等价于 $T(a, b)$，且和组合顺序无关，这从矩阵乘法也可以看出来：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & a \\0 & 1 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}·\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 1 & b \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 1 & b \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}·\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & a \\0 & 1 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & a \\0 & 1 & b \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}</script><p>同样的，$S(u, 0)$ 和 $S(0, v)$ 组合起来等价于 $S(u, v)$ 且和组合顺序无关。而 Skew 无此性质。事实上：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix}1 & tan(\alpha) & 0 \\0 & 1 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}·\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\tan(\beta) & 1 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1+tan(\alpha)tan(\beta) & tan(\alpha) & 0 \\tan(\beta) & 1 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}</script><p>而：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\tan(\beta) & 1 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}·\begin{bmatrix}1 & tan(\alpha) & 0 \\0 & 1 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1 & tan(\alpha) & 0 \\tan(\beta) & 1+tan(\alpha)tan(\beta) & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}</script><p>接下来说说 Android 中和 3×3 矩阵相关的一些类，也就是 <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Matrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matrix</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canvas</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Camera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camera</a> 这 3 个类，注意最后这个  Camera 类是 android.graphics 包中的，而不是 android.hardware 中的。</p><p>Matrix 对象表示一个 3×3 矩阵，常用于指示 x y 平面内的变换，构造函数创建的都是单位矩阵。Matrix 有一系列 set 方法，用于设置矩阵的值，这些方法对应于一些常见的变换操作，比如 setScale(int sx, int sy) 方法，其实就是把矩阵(不管原来是什么值)变成下面的值：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix}sx & 0 & 0 \\0 & sy & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}</script><p>上面的缩放是以原点为 pivot 缩放的，此外，还有 setScale(float sx, float sy, float px, float py) 这样以 (px, py) 为 pivot 进行缩放的操作，等价于把矩阵变为下面这样：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix}sx & 0 & px(1-sx) \\0 & sy & py(1-sy) \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}</script><p>注意以上矩阵是可以分解的，分解为两个矩阵，且这两个矩阵交换位置后的积也是上面的矩阵。其他的 set 方法与此类似，就不多说了。</p><p>Matrix 还有一系列 post 方法和 pre 方法，比如 postRotate(int degrees) 和 preSkew(int kx, int ky) 方法，前者相当于 $M=R(degrees)·M$，后者相当于 $M=M·SK(kx,\ ky)$. 注意这里矩阵相乘的顺序取决于是 post 还是 pre.</p><p>其实 Matrix 也可以在 3 维空间中变换，比如使用它的 setPolyToPoly 方法，可以得到满足指定的映射关系的矩阵。而这种映射关系可能需要 3 为空间的变换才能满足。</p><p>Canvas 类包含一个变换矩阵，这个矩阵可以 get 也可以 set，也可以用 concact(Matrix mat) 来改变 Canvas 的变换矩阵的值，这个过程等价于 $M=M·mat$. 另外，Canvas 的 drawBitmap 方法也可以传入 Matrix 对象来控制 bitmap 被 draw 时需要的施加的变换。Canvas 的 translate 和 rotate 等方法，都是 pre 类型的，并且这种变化，可以理解为是对 canvas 的坐标系进行变化。无变换时，坐标系原点在可见区域的左上角，而 +x 向右，+y 向下。translate(10, 0) 后，canvas 原点向右移动 10，此后绘制在 (0, 0) 位置的东西，其实是位于可见区域的左上角右侧距离为 10 的地方。</p><p>以上说的可见区域，其实是 Canvas 中的 clip 概念，这是一个描述可见区域的矩形。一般 Canvas 的初始 clip 的 ltrb f分别为 0, 0, view width, view height. 当 Canvas 变换时，可理解为其坐标系变换了，那么自然 clip 也会跟着变化，比如 translate(10, 0) 后，clip 的 ltrb 就变为 -10, 0, view width - 10, view height.</p><p>Canvas 出于灵活性考虑，有 save 和 restore 两个方法用于保存和恢复变换的状态，常用做法是，在无变换时 save 一下，然后变换并做绘制，最后restore，以避免影响其它绘制工作。出了translate、rotate、Skew、Scale 这些 2 维变换，Canvas 还有一系列 clip 方法，这些方法将 Canvas 进一步剪裁，并根据剪裁后可见区域是否为空返回布尔值。剪裁操作也是可以 save 和 restore 的，但是注意剪裁操作并不变换坐标系。</p><p>Camera 对象专门用于计算变换，且包含 3 维空间中的变换(相反 Matrix 对象其实只是 xy 平面内的变换)，它的变换计算结果是一个矩阵，可通过 getMatrix 方法得到，一般会将此矩阵用作它用，可以将 Camera 理解为一个变换计算器。出于灵活性的考虑，Camera 对象中有 save 和 restore 操作，这就像是 git 中的 stash 和 pop stash 操作一样，可以把当前的变换保存，并在后面某个时候恢复出来，恢复之前的值将会丢失。不同的是，git stash 后 working tree 将是 clean 的，即已修改的内容都清空了，而 Camera 对象 save 后，它的矩阵还是 save 之前的，并不会变成单位矩阵。</p><p>需要注意的是，Camera 的坐标系，+x 是向右的，+y 是向上的，而 +z 是向屏幕里面的。所以比如 Camera 的 rotateZ(int degrees) 方法和 Matrix 的 [pre|post]Rotate(int degree) 的旋转方向是反过来的。前者等价于逆时针方向转，后者则是顺时针方向转。下面的例子可以说明这一点：</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Matrix mat1 = <span class="keyword">new</span> Matrix();</span><br><span class="line">Camera camera = <span class="keyword">new</span> Camera();</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">camera.rotateZ(-<span class="number">90</span>);</span><br><span class="line">camera.getMatrix(mat1);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Matrix mat2 = <span class="keyword">new</span> Matrix();</span><br><span class="line">mat2.preRotate(<span class="number">90</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>上面代码执行后 mat1 和 mat2 都是：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix}0 & -1 & 0 \\1 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}</script><p>对于 Camera 对象， 调用它的 translate 等方法，会使得它的 matrix 变为 Camera 的坐标系中对应此变换的值，而这样的矩阵，在应用在 Canvas 上进行绘制时，又是作用在 +y 向下的坐标系中。所以比如 Camera translate(10, -20, 0) 后得到的矩阵是：</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 10 \\0 & 1 & 20 \\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}</script><p>需要注意的是，当 Camera 在 z 方向进行 translate 操作时，变换对象在屏幕上的投影大小发生变化，所以，实际变换效果是一个缩放变换，所以 Camera getMatrix 的结果，也是一个二维缩放变换的矩阵。Camera 的 location 也就是 3D 投影中的 camera 位置（观察者位置），此位置默认是 (0, 0, -8)，注意这个 -8 实际相当于 -576 个像素。当 z 方向 translate 距离为正时，相当于远离观察者，最终就是缩小的变换，反正是放大的变换。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>很早以前，我使用一部 iPhone 5S 手机，这是第一款带有计步功能的 iPhone 机型，苹果称之为搭载运动协处理器。如果我没记错，iOS 的运动数据，既可以被第三方 app 读取，也可以被写入。读取好说，写入是因为用户可能使用手环之类的东西来记录数据，那么这些数据可能比 iOS 系统中的数据更受用户重视，所以就可以把 iOS 系统中的数据替换为手环产生的数据，所以需要允许写入。不过目前而言，Android 系统中，第三方应用似乎无法写入系统的运动数据，而只能读取。</p><p>回到正题，众所周知，微信有个微信运动功能。Android 版微信是怎么计步的呢？我最先是在微信的权限页发现微信声明了 Body Sensors 权限，如下所示：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2018/11/23/1542956043.png" alt=""></p><p>这个权限很有迷惑性，让人以为有这个就可以读 Android 系统产生的计步数据了。事实上，把这个权限关了，然后晃动手机 20 次，再进入微信运动，步数很准确的增加了 20 次左右，所以这个权限并不影响读取计步数据。</p><p>那这个权限可以干嘛呢？Body Sensors 权限被列为 dangerous permission，所属的 permission group 仅有这一个权限。不过很遗憾，我在网上查了挺久，没有查到获得这个权限后可以用来写什么代码做什么事情。倘若想要了解此权限的根底，估计需要在 AOSP 中找答案了。可惜我电脑上次升级失败后，目前我电脑中没有完整的 AOSP。</p><p>就目前我在网上了解到的信息而言，此权限似乎没什么用，很多帖子都在询问 Google Play Services 为何要使用此权限以及是否可以关闭该权限。我手中的 Pixel XL 也仅有 Google Play Services 和微信声明了此权限：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2018/11/24/1543033517.png" alt=""></p><p>根据网上的帖子，在 Android 7 时代的某个时候，Gmail 有个 bug，即关闭 Google Play Services 的 Body Sensors 权限后，Gmail 疯狂弹框显示「This app won’t work properly unless you allow Google Play Services’ request to access the foloowing: <strong>Body Sensors</strong>」，尽管 Gmail 仍能正常工作。因为此弹框太过怪异，随后谷歌修复了此问题，这说明即使是 Google 自己的应用，也没有严格审查自己是否声明了不必要的权限。</p><p>当然把 Google Play Services 的 Body Sensors 权限关闭后，打开 Google Fit 应用时，弹出和上面类似的消息，并且 Google Fit 不再显示我的步数，乍一看，这似乎说得通。但是，此时微信仍然可以正常计步。这说明但就计步这一功能看，Body Sensors 并非必要的。</p><p>事实上我的计步 Demo 应用如上述微信一样，也还可以计步。计步 Demo 中的代码非常简单，Google 自己也有个展示此功能的简单项目 <a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-BatchStepSensor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">android-BatchStepSensor</a>。值得一提的是，Google 的简单项目中 manifest 声明了两项 use-feature，但其实这也不是必要的。第三方应用无需声明任何权限，无需声明任何 use-feature，只需注册一个 android.hardware.SensorEventListener 接口，即可在此接口的 onSensorChanged 方法中源源不断的收到步数更新：</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Override</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">onSensorChanged</span><span class="params">(SensorEvent event)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">switch</span> (event.sensor.getType()) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">case</span> Sensor.TYPE_STEP_DETECTOR:</span><br><span class="line">            stepDetector ++;</span><br><span class="line">            tvDetector.setText(stepDetector + <span class="string">""</span>);</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">break</span>;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">case</span> Sensor.TYPE_STEP_COUNTER:</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="comment">// event.values[0] is step count since last reboot of Android device</span></span><br><span class="line">            stepCounter = (<span class="keyword">int</span>) event.values[<span class="number">0</span>];</span><br><span class="line">            tvCounter.setText(stepCounter + <span class="string">""</span>);</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">break</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>这样第三方应用就可以计步了，即使第三方应用进程终止，也可以在应用再次运行时，在 onSensorChanged 方法中得知新的步数。</p><p>值得注意的是，系统返回的步数始终是上次重启设备后的总步数。那么第三方应用使用这种方式计步时，会存在一个问题，即应用进程被杀后，如果用户先运动，然后重启设备，然后才打开第三方应用，那么第三方应用会丢失从应用被杀到设备重启之间的步数，而只知道设备重启后新增了多少步数。</p><p>经过验证，我的 demo、微信还有 Google Fit 均存在此问题。这说明微信和 Google Fit (或者它依赖的 Google Play Services) 都是通过注册 SensorEventListener 接口来获知步数的。这也说明了微信声明 Body Sensors 权限是冗余的。</p><p>那么 Body Sensors 权限到底可以用来做什么？这是一个待填的坑。</p><p>对了，网上还有种方式，通过监听手机加速度感应器的事件来自己计步，至于准确性，那就受自己的算法的科学性和复杂性的限制了。方法也是注册 SensorEventListener，不过注册的 type 是 android.hardware.Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER 而非前面的 TYPE_STEP_COUNTER。更多细节见<a href="http://www.gadgetsaint.com/android/create-pedometer-step-counter-android/#.W_jYq5MzYkp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">此帖子</a>。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>自打来到杭州后，调试 Android app 时用 Charles 做代理的场景成了非常常见的操作，而让人烦恼的是，每次都需要进入手机的 WiFi -&gt; 点击当前 WiFi -&gt; 点击编辑 -&gt; 点击 Advanced options -&gt; proxy 选择 None 或者 Manual -&gt; 上一步如果选了 Manual, 则需要输入 IP 地址和端口号 -&gt; 保存。</p><p>这样一个六七步的步骤，真的很让人烦，而如果电脑的局域网 IP 地址不固定的话，就更加让人不爽了，意味着每次电脑重新联网后，手机都需要重新设置代理的 IP。就算电脑 IP 固定，当手机需要使用 Charles 代理或者关闭代理，都比较麻烦。所以很久前我就想有没有方法可以一键设置代理。</p><p>我的构想是，如果电脑 IP 地址不固定，那么一键设置需要在电脑上操作，不然无法获知电脑的 IP，当然也可以电脑运行个 socket server，然后手机连接，然后电脑把 IP 发给手机。如果电脑 IP 地址固定，最理想的则是手机上一键设置，这样就不需要 adb 连接了。</p><p>经过一番 google

(即 IP 和 port) 用反射的方法设置进去，然后更新 WiFi configuration，并断开 WiFi 并重新连接 WiFi。以上设置代理和关闭代理的动作，全部由上面的代码一键完成，直接在手机上运行即可，并且代码运行结果和手机 Settings 中的 UI 结果是一致的，感觉相当完美。</p><p>然而方法一不支持 API 23 以上的 Android 系统，而所用 API 21 测试是可以完美运行的，在如今 API 28 都发布了的时候，不支持 API 23 以上可以说让实用性大打折扣。不过这是可以理解的，毕竟处于安全考虑，不能让用户的手机随便被第三方 app 默默修改了代理，这太危险了。</p><p>方法二：</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span

android.provider.Settings.Global.GLOBAL_HTTP_PROXY_PORT);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Android 不运行第三方应用新增这样的属性值，而只有 read 的权限，所以需要 adb 来新增这些属性值，除了这个缺点，还有更致命的缺陷。方法二的 reset proxy 的方法是：</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">adb shell settings delete global http_proxy</span><br><span

class="line"><span class="comment"># 是的，目前我已知的方法，只有重启才能让上述 delete 生效，当然手动重启都可以。</span></span><br><span class="line">adb reboot</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>要 reset proxy，删除 key value 和重启 (目前我只知道重启可以) 缺一不可，否则设备只能通过 proxy 使用 http。也就是连别的 wifi 或者使用数据流量都不能使用 http！要想不重启，除非在将 key value 设置为另一个有效的 proxy 配置，这个缺陷可以说非常致命了。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最近把 <a href="https://github.com/card-io/card.io-Android-SDK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Card.IO</a> 改造成一个 aar 依赖提供给公司的项目使用。这个 aar 中使用了几个 so 库。只不过没有提供 armeabi 类型的 so 库，而只有 armeabi-v7a 和 armeabi-v8a 之类的 so 库。所以初次提供给公司项目使用时，出现了找不到 so 的错误，也就是 UnsatisfiedLinkError 错误。也就是下面这样的提示：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2018/09/01/1535807292.png" alt=""></p><p>后面我想尽办法提供了 armeabi 类型的 so 库，这个问题就算告一段落了，然后这还不是结束。今天，测试又发了一段崩溃日志，也就是下面这样的日志：</p><p><img src="http://tao93.top/images/2018/09/01/1535807316.png" alt=""></p><p>因为之前出现过找不到 so 库的问题，所以乍一看上面的日志，我们都以为又是找不到 so 库 (为我们的菜表示羞愧 🤩)。然后经过上网查找，并和 native 的代码对比，我才意识到，上面的日志其实是 so 库是找到了的，只不过是加载 so 库时，调用 JNI_onLoad 这个 native 方法时出错了。此外，向测试要了 debug 包，发现没有问题，所以初步断定是混淆的问题，然后就是排查了。</p><p>我把测试提供给我的 release 包反编译，然后和 JNI_onLoad 方法中的 native 代码对比，终于找到原因了：release 包中，我提供的库的某个方法被混淆掉了，但是这个方法是需要被 JNI_onLoad 方法调用的。所以问题就是：一个需要被 so 库调用的 Java 方法被混淆了！其实，很多时候我们的项目引入一些著名的第三方包 (比如 Knife 之类的) 时，都会在我们的项目的 Proguard 配置文件中声明不要混淆这些三方包的代码，为的就是避免上面这个问题。说一句显得有点废话的话：第三方包发布混淆包时，他们的 Proguard 配置文件只能在他们的 aar 包构建时生效，而在他们的 aar 构建到我们的项目中时，他们的 Proguard 早已鞭长莫及不起作用了。</p><p>回到我遇到的这个问题，我们本地自测时，很少会进行混淆，本地的 release 默认都是未混淆的 (minifyEnabled 是 false)，所以自测的时候根本没有注意到这个问题。这次这个 bug 的解决办法之一是，在最终使用我的 aar 的项目中，显示声明不要混淆我这个 aar 中的某些代码，这就和上一段说的声明不混淆第三方包的代码是一样的。But，还有一种更好的方法，那就是使用 com.android.support.support-annotations 支持库中的 @Keep 注解，此注解可以标记哪些方法或者类在最终构建 apk 时不会被混淆掉 (当然在前面的 aar 构建等过程自然也不会混淆)。</p><p>总结一下，当前项目的 Proguard 配置文件只能在当前项目构建输出产物时起作用，而无法确保输出的产物交给其他项目集成时不被混淆。若要确保后者，那就可以用 support-annotations 支持库中的注解了。</p>]]></content>
